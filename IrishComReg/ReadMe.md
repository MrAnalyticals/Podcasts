**Podcast Files for Discussion on the Irish Data Regulator - ComReg**

In this discussion our two hosts discuss the role of the Office of the Communications Regulator for Ireland (ComReg).

The EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) provides the overarching framework for data protection across the EU, ComReg ensures compliance with these regulations within the communications sector in Ireland. This includes overseeing how personal data is handled by telecom operators and other entities within its remit. The EU AI Act will be policed by ComReg and will further add to it regulatory remit controlling businesses and government agencies, alike, in their usage of AI systems.
